# Getting Started for Direct-connected device

SmartThings Direct-connected devices are Wi-Fi enabled devices that use the SmartThings cloud as their primary cloud infrastructure. And these devices will use the MQTT protocol for communication.

This article demonstrates how to integrate a direct-connected device with SmartThings.

## Workflow

When developing a new direct-connected device application with SmartThings Device SDK (STDK for short), you will progress through the following steps. You can also refer to the [Code Lab data of the 2019 Samsung Developer Conference](https://developer.samsung.com/codelab/smartThings/device/overview). It will be more practical for you to understand the STDK.

## Setup Environment

The first thing you need to do is set up your programming environment.

### Get STDK source code

There are two git repositories for working with the SmartThings Device SDK. The first git repository is for the Internet of Things (IoT) core device library itself, while the second git repository is for sample device applications that use this IoT core device library on the original chipset vendor's SDK.

- [IoT Core Device Library](https://github.com/SmartThingsCommunity/st-device-sdk-c)
- [Reference](https://github.com/SmartThingsCommunity/st-device-sdk-c-ref)

#### Download Reference

You can just choose to download the [Reference repository](https://github.com/SmartThingsCommunity/st-device-sdk-c-ref) from GitHub, if you use a chipset that has already been ported. In this case, the `IoT Core Device Library` and `a chipset SDK` can be easily downloaded as submodules in this Reference repository through the predefined `setup.sh` script. If you are the first to use this STDK, we strongly recommend  that you choose the [Reference repository](https://github.com/SmartThingsCommunity/st-device-sdk-c-ref) for easier understanding.

From the terminal, navigate to the directory you want the STDK to live and clone it using the following git command:

```sh
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/SmartThingsCommunity/st-device-sdk-c-ref.git
```

> **Note** :
>
> For the rest of this document, we will assume the above path (~/st-device-sdk-c-ref) is the default reference source code.

You can use a script to automatically download the `IoT Core Device Library` and `a chipset vendor's SDK` as follows:

```sh
$ cd ~/st-device-sdk-c-ref
$ ./setup.sh
    Usage: ./setup.sh CHIP_NAME
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    ex) ./setup.sh esp8266
    ex) ./setup.sh esp32
    ex) ./setup.sh rtl8195
    ex) ./setup.sh rtl8720c
    ex) ./setup.sh rtl8721c

$ ./setup.sh esp8266                       # ./setup.sh {chip_name}
```

### Create device identity

In order for your IoT device to connect to the SmartThings Cloud, there are required authentication data files. To create these authentication data, you must know your MNID in the personal information window of  [Developer Workspace](https://smartthings.developer.samsung.com/workspace/). Please sign in with Samsung Account and then check your MNID first.

Open a terminal window and run the following `stdk-keygen` command to create a Device Identity.

> **Info :**
>
> If you want to directly run the  `stdk-keygen` command, please add the `$HOME/st-device-sdk-c-ref/iot-core/tools/keygen/linux` path in your `.bashrc` file like below and log out and log in back to make the `.bashrc` changes effective.
>
> PATH="$PATH:$HOME/st-device-sdk-c-ref/iot-core/tools/keygen/linux"
```sh
$ cd ~/st-device-sdk-c-ref/iot-core/tools/keygen/linux
$ ./stdk-keygen -h
usage: stdk-keygen -m MNID [-f firmware_version]

$ ./stdk-keygen -m **** -f V201910       # replace '****' with your MNID
Go Device Identity of Developer Workspace.

Serial Number:
┌──────────┬──────────┐
│ STDK**** │ ce**2**3 │
└──────────┴──────────┘

Public Key:
1D********a21F********8WwP********yU/n8vFvM=

$ tree
.
├── ed25519.pubkey
├── ed25519.seckey
└── output_STDK****ce**2**3
    └── device_info.json
$
$ cat output_STDK****ce**2**3/device_info.json
{
  "deviceInfo": {
    "firmwareVersion": "V201910",
    "privateKey": "3d********AOyY********ezJQ********TMKLGxzbQ=",
    "publicKey": "1D********a21F********8WwP********yU/n8vFvM=",
    "serialNumber": "STDK****ce**2**3"
  }
}
```

Copy the Serial Number and Public Key after running the command. You will need to upload these values to the SmartThings Cloud via [Developer Workspace](https://smartthings.developer.samsung.com/workspace/projects) during the next phase.

If you create a device identity with a command with an option like above,  You can get the ready-to-use `device_info.json` file directly.

### Setup toolchain

You must setup a toolchain according to each chipset you selected.

***Example for ESP8266*** :

*In fact, ESP8266 supports multiple host environments including Windows, Linux, and macOS. But, based on experience, compile times are significantly faster on Linux. Therefore, we will only describe the Linux environment. And yet, if you prefer to use another environment, please refer to the Espressif's guideline matched on the Espressif Doc site. For more details, see the following document.*

- *[ESP8266 Toolchain for Linux](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp8266-rtos-sdk/en/latest/get-started/linux-setup.html)*

*In order to use the pre-supplied build script(e.g. `build.sh`), please extract [the toolchain](https://dl.espressif.com/dl/xtensa-lx106-elf-linux64-1.22.0-100-ge567ec7-5.2.0.tar.gz) into `~/esp/xtensa-lx106-elf/` directory like the original Expressif guide. And according to the above Espressif guideline, you will need to add the toolchain path to your PATH environment variable in ~/.profile file. But it is not necessary if you use the pre-supplied build script. Because that path is automatically exported in the build script.*

> ***Info :***
> *The ESP8266 example of STDK was developed from the 19cfb19 commit ID based on ESP8266_RTOS_SDK v3.2.*



***Example for ESP32*** :

- *[ESP32 Toolchain for Linux](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/get-started/linux-setup.html)*

*In order to use the pre-supplied build script(e.g. `build.sh`), please extract [the toolchain](https://dl.espressif.com/dl/xtensa-esp32-elf-linux64-1.22.0-80-g6c4433a-5.2.0.tar.gz) into `~/esp/xtensa-esp32-elf/` directory like the original Expressif guide. And according to the above Espressif guideline, you will need to add the toolchain path to your PATH environment variable in ~/.profile file. But it is not necessary if you use the pre-supplied build script. Because that path is automatically exported in the build script.*

> ***Info :***
>
> *The ESP32 example of STDK was developed from the beb34b5 commit ID based on esp-idf v3.3.*



***Example for RTL8195***

- *Install [mbed Microcontroller](https://os.mbed.com/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration) to use the USB serial port on Windows.*
- *Upgrade [DAP F/W](https://www.amebaiot.com/en/change-dap-firmware/)*
  *Recommended DAP F/W is the `DAP_FW_Ameba_V12_1_3-2M.bin`*

> ***Note :***
>
> *You have to proceed the above steps at Windows PC for downloading a binary. But you have to build the source code on the cygwin or linux for this chipset.*



## Register a Device

Now that the programming environment is setup, you need to register device information to the SmartThings Cloud.

First, please sign in to the [Developer Workspace](https://smartthings.developer.samsung.com/workspace/) with a Samsung Account.

<img src="res/sign_in.jpg" style="zoom:100%;" align="left"/>



### Create a new project

Press "NEW PROJECT" button and select "Device Integration".

<img src="res/create_project1.jpg" style="zoom:100%;" align="left"/>

Select Direct-connected device and enter a name for this project.

<img src="res/create_project2.jpg" style="zoom:100%;" align="left"/>

After pressing "CREATE PROJECT" button, a direct-connected device project will be created on the SmartThings Cloud.



### Create a device profile

A device profile contains the components, capabilities, and metadata (ID, name, etc.). This information defines the actions and attributes that an IoT device can perform.

Click the "GO TO DEVICE PROFILE" and then, enter the all remaining information required.

<img src="res/create_device_profile.jpg" style="zoom:50%;" align="left"/>

At this time, please note that you will need to add a "[Health Check](https://smartthings.developer.samsung.com/docs/devices/health.html)" capability to update the connectivity status of a device. It is only required on the `main` component.

<img src="res/add_health_check_capability_switch.jpg" style="zoom:90%;" align="left"/>



### Create device onboarding information

This defines information to support the initial connection process between IoT device and SmartThings Cloud.

Click the "GO TO DEVICE ONBOARDING" and then, enter the all remaining information required.

<img src="res/create_onboarding_profile.jpg" style="zoom:50%;" align="left"/>



### Deploy to test

You can publish your device to the SmartThings platform for testing. And then you will be able to access your device through the SmartThings app. Actually this step is for self-testing. If you want to officially publish your device with enrolled organizations ID(e.g. company MNID), please refer to the process below.

- [Official Publishing Process](https://smartthings.developer.samsung.com/docs/devices/publishing/publishing-basics.html)

<img src="res/deploy_to_test_switch.jpg" style="zoom:100%;" align="left"/>



### Upload device identity

This step uploads device identity data generated in the first phase.

Enter the serial number.

<img src="res/device_identity_sn.jpg" style="zoom:70%;" align="left"/>

Paste the public key that copied from the first phase in the Public Key value box that appears

And then, click ADD button.

<img src="res/input_public_key.jpg" style="zoom:50%;" align="left"/>



### Download onboarding_config.json

This is the information that the IoT device must have in order to connect to the SmartThings Cloud.

If you use a pre-supplied sample device application, please download it and then, just overwrite the existing `onboarding_config.json` file is in the `main` directory of sample device application with the new one you downloaded. In fact, overwriting is just one of several possible ways to inject it to the device. If the json information is guaranteed to be a parameter in the `st_conn_init()` function, you can refer to it differently according to your own development way.

<img src="res/downloading_onboarding_config_file_switch.jpg" style="zoom:70%;" align="left"/>



## Develop a device application

You have set up the environment and registered a device, so now it is time to develop a new device application in the STDK reference repository.

### Create a new device project

An easy way to get started is to branch out one of the example projects provided in the git repository. We will use the "st_switch" application from the STDK directory here.

```sh
# Full path of the ESP8266
~/st-device-sdk-c-ref/apps/esp8266/st_switch/
```

### Update device information

Your IoT device needs two pieces of information when connecting to the SmartThings Cloud :

- Device Identity
- onboarding_config.json

1. Device Identity

   Device identity provides data that need to be sent for authentication with the server. There are two different packets of information, one is ED25519 and the other is X.509.

   - **ED25519**

     All of the device identity data are included in the `device_info.json` file in the `main` directory of the device application.

     If you create a device identity with a command with an option like `./stdk-keygen -m **** -f V201910` like the first phase,  you can get the ready-to-use `device_info.json` file directly. In this case, please make sure you overwrite the existing `device_info.json` file with the new one you created.

     ```sh
     # Overwrite device_info.json with a new one
     $ cp ./output_STDK****ce**2**3/device_info.json ~/st-device-sdk-c-ref/apps/esp8266/st_switch/main/
     ```

     > **Note :**
     >
     > If you are using the `device_info.json` file, please disable the build configuration associated with SmartThings Non-Volatile memory partition(STNV for short) as follows. Once again, don't set the build configuration below to `y`. :
     >
     > `CONFIG_STDK_IOT_CORE_SUPPORT_STNV_PARTITION=`

     But, the manufacturers cannot place the device identity data on the source code because it is not possible to build and flash each time for each device. To resolve this problem in the commercial level device application, these device identity data for each device should be flashed into a secure partition area during the manufacturing process and a method to access data stored in a secure partition area should be implemented for each chipset.

     For Espressif chipset, we have provided these solutions(e.g. a secure partition area(we call it STNV) and a method to access data stored in STNV) as an example, so please refer to it. You can find this example in the source code with the `CONFIG_STDK_IOT_CORE_SUPPORT_STNV_PARTITION` keyword.

     **[The example of flashed items in the Espressif chipset]**

     | Flashed items | Type | Description                   | Examples                 |
     | :------------ | :--- | :---------------------------- | :----------------------- |
     | PKType        | data | PubKey Algorithm type         | ED25519                  |
     | CACert        | file | Server CA Certificate         | root.crt.pem             |
     | PublicKey     | file | Client (= Device) Public key  | device.pubkey.b64        |
     | PrivateKey    | file | Client (= Device) Private key | device.seckey.b64        |
     | SerialNum     | data | Device Serial Number          | STDK\*\*\*\*ce\*\*2\*\*3 |

     > **Note :**
     >
     > If you want to flash the device identity data in a specific partition, you should set the build configuration below to `y`. : 
     >
     > `CONFIG_STDK_IOT_CORE_SUPPORT_STNV_PARTITION=y`

   - **X.509**

     It will be supported later.

2. onboarding_config.json

   Place the `onboarding_config.json` file created during the device registration phase in the `main` directory of device application. Please make sure you overwrite the existing `onboarding_config.json` file with the new one you created like `device_info.json` file above.

   ***Example***

   ```sh
   # Location for st_switch app of ESP8266
   ~/st-device-sdk-c-ref/apps/esp8266/st_switch/main/onboarding_config.json
   ```

   ```sh
   # Example of onboarding_config.json
   {
     "onboardingConfig": {
       "deviceOnboardingId": "OI_SWITCH_01",
       "mnId": "****",
       "setupId": "001",
       "vid": "VID_SWITCH_01",
       "deviceTypeId": "Switch",
       "ownershipValidationTypes": [
         "BUTTON"
       ],
       "identityType": "ED25519"
     }
   }
   ```

   - deviceOnboardingId : It is a prefix to be used for the SSID of Soft-AP during Easy-setup process. This value comes from `Device Onboarding ID` when doing "Create a device information" on the DevWS. By default, the last four digits(e.g. 7c16) of the example below represent the last four digits of the Serial Number of device.
     - Example of SSID : OI_SWITCH_01_E4mnId......7c16
   - mnId : Manufacturer ID. A unique four-letter ID assigned to SmartThings developers (individual MNID) or enrolled organizations (company MNID) that can be viewed at "My Page > MNID".
   - setupId : a unique three-digit number. This value comes from `Setup ID` when doing "Create device onboarding information" on the DevWS.
   - vid :   An alphanumeric identifier for your device. This value comes from `Vendor ID` when doing "Create a device profile" on the DevWS.
   - deviceTypeId : This determines the device's icon and default UI layout in the SmartThings app. This is the value you selected from the value given as a list when doing "Create a device profile".
   - ownershipValidationTypes : This is the type of ownership confirmation used during onboarding process. This value comes from `Confirm Method` when doing "Create a device profile" on the DevWS. Currently, there are four supported types.
     - JUSTWORKS
     - BUTTON
     - PIN
     - QR

   - identityType : A unique certificate or public key pair type used to authenticate a device on SmartThings Cloud. You can choose between
     - ED25519
     - *X.509 (will be supported)*

### Develop device application

A device application is developed using the APIs provided by the IoT Core Device Library. We recommend reuse of the pre-supplied sample device applications, like `st_switch`. This allows for rapid development as you begin to develop your new device. Please refer to the [API references](https://github.com/SmartThingsCommunity/st-device-sdk-c/blob/master/doc/STDK_APIs.pdf) related to the IoT core device library as shown:

- connection management
  - st_conn_init()
  - st_conn_set_noti_cb()
  - st_conn_start()
  - st_conn_cleanup()
  - st_conn_ownership_confirm()

- capability management
  - st_cap_handle_init()
  - st_cap_cmd_set_cb()
  - st_cap_attr_create_int()
  - st_cap_attr_create_number()
  - st_cap_attr_create_string()
  - st_cap_attr_create_string_array()
  - st_cap_attr_free()
  - st_cap_attr_send()

***Main function example for ESP8266*** :

```sh
/**
SmartThings Device SDK(STDK) aims to make it easier to develop IoT devices by providing
additional IoT Core Library to the existing chipset vendor's SW Architecture.

That is, you can simply develop a basic device application by just calling the APIs provided by IoT Core Device Library like below. Currently, IoT Core Device Library offers 13 APIs.

//create an iot context
1. st_conn_init();

//create a handle to process capability
2. st_cap_handle_init();

//register a callback function to process capability command when it comes from the SmartThings Cloud.
3. st_cap_cmd_set_cb();

//needed when it is necessary to keep monitoring the device status
4. user_defined_task()

//process on-boarding procedure. There is nothing more to do on the app side than call the API.
5. st_conn_start();
*/

void app_main(void)
{

    unsigned char *onboarding_profile = (unsigned char *) onboarding_profile_start;
    unsigned int onboarding_profile_len = onboarding_profile_end - onboarding_profile_start - 1;
    unsigned char *device_info = (unsigned char *) device_info_start;
    unsigned int device_info_len = device_info_end - device_info_start - 1;
    IOT_CAP_HANDLE *handle = NULL;
    int iot_err;

    // 1. create an iot context
    ctx = st_conn_init(onboarding_profile, onboarding_profile_len, device_info, device_info_len);
    if (ctx != NULL) {
      iot_err = st_conn_set_noti_cb(ctx, cap_switch_noti_cb, NULL);
      if (iot_err)
        printf("fail to set notification callback function\n");

    // 2. create a handle to process capability
    // implement init_callback function (cap_switch_init_cb)
    handle = st_cap_handle_init(ctx, "main", "switch", cap_switch_init_cb, NULL);

    // 3. register a callback function to process capability command when it comes from the SmartThings Cloud
    // implement callback function (cap_switch_cmd_off_cb)
    iot_err = st_cap_cmd_set_cb(handle, "off", cap_switch_cmd_off_cb, NULL);
    if (iot_err)
      printf("fail to set cmd_cb for off\n");

    // implement callback function (cap_switch_cmd_on_cb)
    iot_err = st_cap_cmd_set_cb(handle, "on", cap_switch_cmd_on_cb, NULL);
    if (iot_err)
      printf("fail to set cmd_cb for on\n");

    } else {
      printf("fail to create the iot_context\n");
    }

    // 4. needed when it is necessary to keep monitoring the device status
    xTaskCreate(smartswitch_task, "smartswitch_task", 2048, (void *)handle, 10, NULL);

    // 5. process on-boarding procedure. There is nothing more to do on the app side than call the API.
    st_conn_start(ctx, (st_status_cb)&iot_status_cb, IOT_STATUS_ALL, NULL, NULL);

}
```

### Build & Flash the App

Go to the root directory of the STDK and execute the build script(build.sh) with the below parameter.

```sh
# Example for ESP8266
$ cd ~/st-device-sdk-c-ref/
$ ./build.sh esp8266 st_switch             # ./build.sh {chip_name} {app_directory}
```

After compiling, following results can be seen. In fact, as you know, we have to flash these results according to the binary download method that exists per chipset.

```sh
# Example for ESP8266
$ cd ~/st-device-sdk-c-ref/
$ tree output/ -L 3
output/
`-- esp8266
    `-- iotcore_st_switch_20200211_ab144f7_d63f3d2    #iotcore_'app_name'_'date'_'commit'
        |-- address_info.txt
        |-- bootloader.bin
        |-- debug
        |-- ota_data_initial.bin
        |-- partitions.2MB.bin
        `-- smart_switch_demo.bin
```

In case of Espressif chipset(e.g. ESP8266, ESP32), you can now run the following command to flash the entire binaries(e.g. app, bootloader, and init data bin) to the chipset.

```sh
# Example for ESP8266
# ./build.sh {chip_name} {app_name} {option}
$ cd ~/st-device-sdk-c-ref/
$ ./build.sh esp8266 st_switch flash
```

The serial port needs to be matched to the computer environment for serial port flashing. For example, the settings for serial port flashing can be configured with `menuconfig` option in Espressif. If the serial port setting does not match your environment, please execute the following:

> Note :
> The `menuconfig` option is only supported on the Espressif chipset. If you use a different chipset, please set it according to the selected original chipset guide.
```sh
# Example for ESP8266
# ./build.sh {chip_name} {app_name} {option}
$ cd ~/st-device-sdk-c-ref
$ ./build.sh esp8266 st_switch menuconfig
```

Plus, You don't need to run `./build.sh esp8266 st_switch` before running `./build.sh esp8266 st_switch flash`, this will automatically rebuild everything that needs to be built before flashing.

For more details about flashing and monitoring, please refer to the [README](https://github.com/SmartThingsCommunity/st-device-sdk-c-ref/blob/master/README.md) file.

### Test

The SmartThings App should be used to control an IoT device that is running with the SmartThings Cloud. Go to Google Play or the iOS App Store and download the SmartThings app on your phone.

| Step | Description                                                  |
| :--: | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
